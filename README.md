# Soho House Foreign Exchange Calculator

Thanks for interviewing with Soho House! Please read me before starting to write code üßë‚Äçüíª

### Brief

We need to build a foreign exchange calculator so the finance team at Soho House can easily compare live foreign exchange prices from around the world.

The JS team has started this task but we need you to finish it! Have a look around the codebase, and then follow the instructions in the [Build Setup](#build-setup) section to get the app running.

Some notes:

- Please treat this is as if you were really pairing, so talk your partner through what you're thinking and feel free to ask questions or use google.
- Don't worry about finishing! We'd prefer to see how you work than get everything done.
- If some instructions are a little vague, take it as an invitation to use your imagination and best judgement.
- Making your work look good on screen is a bonus‚Äîyou'll find the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/) framework included, feel free to use it if you'd like.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Task 1

On the homepage, you'll find an input field and list of the user's favourite currencies. Please complete this functionality so the user can input a value and see that value converted into their favourite currencies.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Task 2

Currently we only have dummy data! Please use [this free API endpoint](https://api.exchangerate.host/latest) to give the user more currencies to work with.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Task 3 (Bonus ‚ú®)

If you click the _Add new currency_ button, you'll find that the user can't actually favourite a new currency. Please complete this functionality so that a user can add a new currency to their favourites.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Task 4 (Extra Bonus üöÄ)

The input field on the homepage has a dropdown next to it, but it currently only has `EUR` in it. Please allow the user to choose from any of the available currencies for their input value.

### Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# run the tests
$ npm run test
```
